  { key: 'appointment', question: 'How do I make an appointment?', answer: "Please call us at (530) 758-4900 to get in touch. We'll be happy to set up an appointment to address your concerns." },
  { key: 'first-visit', question: 'What should I expect on my first visit?', answer: "For an immediate need or an emergency, we will ask you to fill out a health form, diagnose the problem, and arrange to treat you as quickly as possible. If you need to establish continuing care, we always start with a private meeting with the dentist to determine the best way to get you started, take any necessary records – including digital x-rays and photographs – and begin the process of welcoming you as a new patient to our office." },
  { key: 'cost-insurance', question: 'How much will it cost? Do you accept my insurance?', answer: "Nobody likes a surprise bill; we'll let you know how much you can expect to pay ahead of your dental visit. While we are not contracted with any one insurer, if you let us know your insurance information, we will file any claims on your behalf to help maximize your benefits." },
  { key: 'cleanings', question: 'How often should I come in for dental cleanings?', answer: 'We work together with you to determine your suggested interval between dental cleanings. Intervals typically are between three and six months, depending on your risk level for cavities or gum disease.' },
  { key: 'children', question: 'At which age should my children start seeing the dentist?', answer: "A child should see the dentist within six months of their first tooth coming in, or by age one. Dental issues can start early, so it's a great idea to start your child on a lifetime of healthy dental habits. We recommend very young children see a Pediatric dentist for their earliest dental visits. Pediatric dentists, much like Pediatricians, are specialists that receive extra training after dental school to meet the unique needs of children. We work closely with Pediatric dentists in the area so your whole family can receive the highest quality care." },
  { key: 'foods', question: 'Are there certain foods that help support healthy teeth?', content: 'foods' },
  { key: 'smile', question: 'What is the secret to a great smile?', answer: "Healthy gums and teeth will often lead to your best smile. However, if nature didn't give you the smile you want, we can help you attain the smile you desire." },
  { key: 'home-care', question: 'What home care do you recommend?', answer: "Hygiene is not one-size-fits-all. With all the different tools and techniques available these days, it can be overwhelming to navigate the toothbrush aisle. We always provide oral hygiene instruction free of charge to our patients, because we want to help you get the most out of your routine." },
  { key: 'brush-floss', question: 'How often should I brush and floss?', answer: "Ideally, you should be brushing for at least 2 minutes in the morning and in the evening (try timing yourself - this may be longer than you think!) Flossing should happen when you brush; it doesn't matter whether you brush or floss first. If you find you need to brush or floss more than this, that's fine - just make sure you're being gentle!" },
  { key: 'emergency', question: "How will I know if I'm experiencing a true dental emergency?", answer: "If you are experiencing trauma or swelling that is impacting your breathing, or if you have uncontrolled bleeding, you should seek help at a hospital right away. Urgent dental needs include severe tooth or jaw pain, localized gum or facial swelling, a cracked tooth, or trauma that dislodges a tooth from the mouth. Less urgent dental issues that can still be unsettling include losing a filling or crown. We can help you determine the next best course of action if you have an urgent dental problem." },
